# myapi-android-sdk
Android SDK to ease interaction with myapi API suite.

# Getting Started

You can get started with some examples just downloading the source code.

Add an entry to the AndroidManifest.xml file of your project (or modify the AndroidManifest.xml file of the example project) with the following meta-data tag:

```
<meta-data
            android:name="com.parkifast.mymappi.myapisdk.API_KEY"
            android:value="YOUR_API_KEY" />
```

You can find your api key in your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.mymappi.com/). Remember that the mobile SDKs are not available for Starter plans.
